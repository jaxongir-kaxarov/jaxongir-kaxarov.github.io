**What English Profile does:**

English Profile maps English to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). It describes which aspects of English are typically learned at each CEFR level.

This information is useful for teachers, curriculum developers, textbook authors, and test designers to determine what is appropriate to teach at each level.

The English Profile site ([English Profile](https://englishprofile.org){: target="_blank" }) provides a large amount of data, including two innovative online tools:

1. [English Vocabulary Profile Online](https://englishprofile.org/?menu=evp-online){: target="_blank" } – an online database for vocabulary with level information
2. [English Grammar Profile Online](https://englishprofile.org/?menu=egp-online){: target="_blank" } – an online database for grammar with level information

These databases are searchable and present research-based guidance on which words and grammatical structures are appropriate to teach at each CEFR level.

This work was produced as a collaborative project involving many organisations and is supported by the Council of Europe. The project gathered data from learners worldwide to enrich the research.

The research was carried out by two parts of the University of Cambridge in the UK:
* Cambridge University Press
* Cambridge English Language Assessment

The results are published as Reference Level Descriptions (RLDs) — that is, data-based level descriptions.

### English language challenge — brief overview

For this project I used [AnkiDroid Version 2.20.1](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.ichi2.anki_22001300.apk) and [Anki desktop for Windows 10+](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/releases/download/25.09/anki-launcher-25.09-windows.exe){: target="_blank" }. The EVP and EGP flashcard decks combine the following two structural profiles:

- EVP (English Vocabulary Profile): 14,963 words  
- EGP (English Grammar Profile): 1,218 rules  


[View Anki English Profile deck collections](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks?search=english+profile){: target="_blank" }

| Title                      | Ratings    | Updated        | Cards    | Audio | Images |
|----------------------------|------------|----------------|----------|-------|--------|
| English Profile Vocabulary | —          | 2025-01-27     | 14,963   | 6,664 | 0      |
| English Profile Grammar    | =          | 2025-01-27     | 1,218    | 0     | 0      |

Both cover CEFR (A1–C2) and are designed for systematic, spaced practice.

### Daily routine

A simple, strict daily plan makes progress predictable, for example:

- Lexis — 25 new EVP words per day (Anki cards)  
  - 14,963 ÷ 25 ≈ 599 days
- Grammar — 10 new EGP rules per day  
  - 1,218 ÷ 10 ≈ 122 days

Overall, the program runs for about 1.5 years; the grammar set finishes earlier and can be reviewed while continuing vocabulary study.

### How I will study (card structure)

Each Anki card will contain:

![light mode only](evp-light.png){: .light .w-75 .shadow .rounded-10 }
![dark mode only](evp-dark.png){: .dark .w-75 .shadow .rounded-10 }

- the word or grammar rule
- IPA pronunciation for words
- a short definition
- at least one real example sentence

This is not passive reading; it encourages active recall.

### How the blog works

Each daily post includes:
- 25 EVP words (with examples)
- 10 EGP rules (with explanations and examples)
- common mistakes and difficult points
- a short personal note
- mnemonic suggestions for memorization

Posts are organized by day (Day-001, Day-002, …) and by type (EVP / EGP, Vocabulary / Grammar) to make it easy to find and study specific material.

### Goal

Goal: strengthen an active vocabulary across A1–C2 levels. The blog serves as a study diary and motivation for completing this challenge.
