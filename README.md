This is a personal study blog where I systematically organize and document what I learn over time.

The site primarily focuses on:

* **Mathematics**
* **Machine Learning and Data Science**
* **Artificial Intelligence**
* **Scientific Computing and Programming**
* **Technical notes on tools and environments**

The purpose of this blog is to build a structured knowledge base, support long-term learning, and make complex topics easier to revisit and connect.
